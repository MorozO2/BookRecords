# BookRecords
Project for C++ course, Metropolia Fall 2018.

Application for storing, viewing and editing records of books and people with library cards.

The applicaton loads the records from a txt file in the source folder into a vector, from which the user searches and edits the records.
Before the application can be closed, the records must be saved. (Upon chhosing to save, the application writes the contents of the vector into the txt file, overwritting the old contents).
